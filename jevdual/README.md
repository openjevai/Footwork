# jevdual

The package behind [Footwork](../README.md): a guard (done verification against observed state, a
destructive gate, a receipt for every action) in front of whoever drives, with
[TypeSafe Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) as an optional System 1 that picks an operation and a target from a
code-owned menu. Two surfaces share the menu, arbiter, verifier and receipt types: the browser, through
[browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) 0.13.10 (pinned, not forked) or the Cua Driver's
DevTools route, and native macOS apps through the [Cua Driver](https://github.com/trycua/cua)'s
accessibility tree (`cua-driver` 0.28.2, pinned). The operator surface is the `footwork` CLI
(`python/jevdual/cli.py`, `session.py`); see the [top-level README](../README.md#drive-it). Measured hot
paths in the DOM pipeline run in Rust through PyO3, each with a pure-Python twin and equality tests.

The browser tables below are the Q6 to Q9 measurements; native and coexistence results (Q10, Q15) are in
the top-level README and `docs/experiments/`.

## Results

Every number below is in a file under `results/`.

Dev split, 23 local tasks (`results/g2-dev-three-arms.md`; measured before the verification changes
below, not rerun since):

| arm | pass | false done | LLM calls | Jev calls | est. cost USD | wall s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 only (Jev) | 10/23 | 11 (2 paused) | 0 | 76 | 0.013 | 133 |
| stock browser-use (Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor) | 21/23 | 2 | 65 | 0 | 0.098 | 1,578 |
| dual (Jev + Muse) | 23/23 | 0 (2 paused) | 55 | 189 | 0.122 | 1,412 |

Heldout split, 10 local tasks, settings frozen, rerun once on adoption of the verification changes
(`results/heldout-adopt.md`):

| arm | pass | false done | LLM calls | Jev calls | est. cost USD | wall s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| stock | 9/10 | 1 | 33 | 0 | 0.049 | 708 |
| dual | 10/10 | 0 (1 paused) | 24 | 76 | 0.049 | 522 |

Live split, 55 tasks on public and practice sites, three arms after the verification changes
(`results/q6-live-paired.md`):

| arm | pass | false done | LLM calls | Jev calls | est. cost USD | wall s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 only | 13/55 | 23 | 0 | 427 | 0.192 | 787 |
| stock | 51/55 | 1 | 265 | 0 | 0.382 | 5,508 |
| dual | 51/55 | 0 (2 paused) | 196 | 458 | 0.504 | 6,158 |

Q9, the four-arm test of System 2 directing System 1 on the same 55 live tasks
(`results/q9-live-dev.md`): a guarded System 2 alone (gate and verification, no S1 decisions)
matched every arm on verified completions at the lowest cost, $0.0100 per verified pass against
dual's $0.0117 and delegation's $0.0137, with zero false completions on these predicates everywhere.
Dual keeps 26 to 29% fewer driver steps than the guarded arm (23% fewer model requests by
browser-use's tracker in the second sample) and the fewest steps; the first delegation build cost more and
was rebuilt with explicit ownership and measured again (`results/q9c-coherent-delegation.md`): it
reached 5 of 30 assignments and stayed costlier and slower than both baselines, so the reactive loop
remains the default and delegation a tool.

What the splits say: Jev alone handles navigation, search, pagination, modals and login in two to
five steps and cannot read or answer; the LLM alone reads and answers and will click "Delete
account" when asked to reach a page, and its own judge accepts that as success; the pair is the only
arm with zero false completions on every split. On the fixture heldout the pair now matches stock's
cost with 27% fewer driver steps and 26% less wall time. On live sites it uses 26% fewer driver steps than
stock at 1.32× its estimated cost, with the whole gap being Jev call volume (458 calls), and wall time
not distinguishable. Steps run by Jev take a median 1.4 s against 15.7 s for a Muse step; that is a per-step figure, and task
wall time between the arms is not distinguishable on live sites. Jev calls
count every request, including verification. Live pass rates are against sites that drift between
runs (stock lost 5 saucedemo checkout tasks in an evening run that passed in the morning). Per-run
failure taxonomies are in each run directory's `taxonomy.md`.

Native hot paths, replayed DOM CPU per step on recorded pages (`results/r5-dom-pipeline.md`,
`results/r7-boundary-decision.md`):

| fixture | upstream | with patches | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| wikipedia-python (18k nodes) | 146–164 ms | 118 ms | paint order 10 ms to 2.7 ms; per-node uuid removed |
| amazon-usb-c-hub (10k nodes) | 86–90 ms | 64 ms | |

The 50 ms gate was not met. The snapshot-lookup port is equality-proven but not faster, because
upstream's cost is building 18k Python dataclasses, not the lookup; it ships opt-in. The evidence
matcher is 46 to 82x faster and byte-identical to the Python reference on the fixture corpus.

## How it works

- `jevdual/agent.py`: `DualProcessAgent` overrides one upstream method, `_get_next_action`, and
  gates every action before dispatch.
- `jevdual/menu.py` builds the action space from browser-use's selector map within Jev's token budget
  and strips password, card and one-time-code values that upstream leaves in static attributes.
- `jevdual/policy.py` and `prompts.py`: the fan-out request; `arbiter.py` and `arbiter.toml`: the
  escalation rules; `verify.py`: evidence bands and claim checks; `text.py`: literal, secret
  placeholder or a strict helper contract for typed text; `secrets.py`: names only reach models,
  values resolve at dispatch on the matching origin; `tools.py`: `act_toward_goal`, the S1 loop as a
  tool System 2 can call.
- Native arm: `native.py` builds the accessibility-tree menu and re-validates every id against the
  snapshot it came from; `desktop.py` and `desktop_s2.py` run the loop; `posture.py` and `coexist.py`
  keep a session off the person's input and focus; `ax.py` reads values back. `receipts.py` turns
  either surface's effect into the Driver's five words.
- `crates/jevdual-core`: paint order, snapshot lookup, element hashes, evidence matcher.
  `JEVDUAL_PURE_PY=1` forces the Python twins; CI runs both.

## Run it

```sh
uv sync                                    # builds the extension with maturin
uv run pytest                              # native; JEVDUAL_PURE_PY=1 for pure Python
JEVDUAL_BROWSER_TESTS=1 uv run pytest tests/integration tests/test_tools.py
uv run python -m evals.runner --split dev --arm stock --arm dual --llm meta
```

Keys are files under `~/.config/jevdual` (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `META_MODEL_API_KEY`), materialized
from the Sift vault; `jevdual/keys.py` exports them. Requires Rust 1.95 and Python 3.11+.

OpenJEV (https://openjev.sh) is a free community gateway to the same Jev model. To use it instead of
TypeSafe, place an `OPENJEV_API_KEY` file under `~/.config/jevdual` (or export `OPENJEV_API_KEY`), or set
`JEV_PROVIDER=openjev` to force it even when a TypeSafe key is also present. TypeSafe remains the default
when `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is set; see `python/jevdual/provider.py`.

## Credits

Ideas from the MIT-licensed jev-ultrafast, fastbrowse, jev-browser, jev-for-chrome and
public-browser projects: speculative fan-out, consume-once decisions, evidence-before-done,
origin-bound secrets, proposed-versus-executed traces, stable element references. browserclaw
(AGPL) informed the micro-loop-as-tool design; no code was taken from it. browser-use is the
foundation and stays a dependency.
