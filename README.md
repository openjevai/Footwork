**A verified computer-use agent, for the browser and for native macOS apps.** Footwork puts a cheap,
calibrated guard from [TypeSafe Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai) in front of whoever drives: every claimed
completion is checked against observed state and the trajectory before it counts, every irreversible action
passes a gate, and every action comes back with a receipt saying what visibly changed. On top of that guard,
Jev can also take the fast, mechanical steps itself (System 1) while the driver (System 2) keeps the
reading, comparing and deciding. The driver can be an LLM loop (browser-use 0.13.10 as a library, not a
fork) or the operator at the keyboard: a person, or an agent such as a Claude Code session, one command at a
time. Native apps are driven in the background through the [Cua Driver](https://github.com/trycua/cua)'s
accessibility tree, beside a person still using the same Mac.

The Python package is `jevdual` (in [`jevdual/`](jevdual/)); Footwork is the project. Every number below is
from a run directory under [`jevdual/results/`](jevdual/results/), and every experiment was pre-registered in
[`jevdual/docs/experiments/`](jevdual/docs/experiments/) before it ran.

> **OpenJEV support:** Jev is built by [TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai). This fork keeps TypeSafe as the default and adds optional support for [OpenJEV](https://openjev.sh), a free community gateway to the same Jev model — set `OPENJEV_API_KEY` (or `JEV_PROVIDER=openjev`) to use it. Original project: https://github.com/Tom-R-Main/Footwork by @Tom-R-Main.

## Drive it

```sh
footwork start "Compute 48 times 13" --app Calculator --require "The display shows 624"
footwork look                    # the menu of what can be done now, with ids, and the last receipt
footwork s1 --act                # System 1's proposal on this observation (one Jev call), dispatched
footwork do click 12             # through the gate; settle, reobserve, print the receipt
footwork done "624"              # the verifier judges the claim against the window and the trail
```

Also `do type | append | key | hotkey | menu | scroll | enter`, `status`, and `footwork run` for the whole
loop with Jev as System 1 and an LLM as System 2 on escalation. Nothing dispatches on an id from an older
observation; text comes from the task or from named secrets (`{NAME}` read from `$FOOTWORK_SECRET_NAME`,
never printed); `--authorize "<label>"` names the one change the operator approved. Sessions default to
`background_only`: the person's front app, pointer and keyboard are left alone (`--mode` grants more).
`start --browser` drives footwork's own Chrome profile through the Driver's DevTools route instead of the
accessibility tree. Needs macOS with Accessibility granted to the process that runs it, and a TypeSafe key.

Measured this way on 2026-09-25 ([`docs/plans/legible-harness.md`](jevdual/docs/plans/legible-harness.md)):
Calculator 48 × 13 in 30 s (System 1 proposed every step at p ≥ 0.94, verifier accept 0.98); TextEdit
append-and-save in 9 s, the save confirmed by the window title losing its edited mark.

## What it does, measured

### The browser

Three arms are compared on the same tasks: **stock** browser-use with the LLM alone, **guarded** (the LLM behind
Jev verification and the gate, no Jev actions), and **dual** (the guard plus Jev taking the mechanical steps).
System 2 in every run is Muse Spark 1.3 Contributor over the Meta Model API, chosen because it is cheap and
fast and therefore the hardest baseline for Jev to beat on cost.

**Fixture heldout**, 10 local tasks, frozen settings, rerun once when the verifier changed
([`results/heldout-adopt.md`](jevdual/results/heldout-adopt.md)):

| arm | pass | false completions | driver steps | Jev calls | est. cost USD | wall s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| stock | 9/10 | 1 (deleted an account when told to reach the page) | 33 | 0 | 0.049 | 708 |
| dual | 10/10 | 0 (paused before the click) | 24 | 76 | 0.049 | 522 |

**Live sites**, 55 tasks on Wikipedia, MDN, docs.python.org, arXiv, GitHub, PyPI and three practice sites,
three same-code runs ([`results/q9-live-dev.md`](jevdual/results/q9-live-dev.md),
[`results/q9b-coherent.md`](jevdual/results/q9b-coherent.md)):

| arm | pass | false completions | driver steps | Jev calls | est. cost USD | cost per verified pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| guarded | 50 to 52 / 55 | 0 | 226 to 260 | 80 to 84 | 0.385 to 0.412 | 0.0086 to 0.0100 |
| dual | 51 to 52 / 55 | 0 | 161 to 193 | 360 to 391 | 0.449 to 0.492 | 0.0100 to 0.0117 |
| stock (one run) | 51 / 55 | 1 (its own LLM judge accepted it) | 265 | 0 | 0.382 | |

What that says, in order of how sure we are:

- **The guard is the product.** Zero false completions on every split and run, on these predicates, at
  about two Jev calls per task, and at the LLM's own cost. The LLM alone deletes the account when asked to
  reach a page, and its own judge marks that a success.
- **Jev acting saves driver work, not money yet.** Dual makes 23 to 29% fewer driver requests than the
  guarded arm across two same-night samples and runs its own steps at a median 1.4 s against 15.7 s for an
  LLM step, but pays for that in Jev volume; task wall time between the arms is not distinguishable on
  live sites, and dual matches stock's cost only on the fixture heldout so far.
- **System 2 delegating bounded subgoals to Jev did not pay** in three measurements
  ([`Q9`](jevdual/docs/experiments/Q9.md)): more cost, no more completions. The executor reached 5 of 30
  assignments; an audit then found software defects behind most of those failures, fixed in the tree and
  not yet re-measured. Delegation stays available as a tool, off by default.
- **Declaring the contract to the driver did not pay** ([`Q11`](jevdual/docs/experiments/Q11.md)): model
  requests rose 21% per task with completions unchanged. Receipts for every action
  ([`Q12`](jevdual/docs/experiments/Q12.md)) are the next test and are running now.

### Native apps and a shared machine

- **The arbiter's calibration transfers from DOM menus to accessibility-tree menus**
  ([`Q10`](jevdual/docs/experiments/Q10.md), [`results/q10-native-dev.md`](jevdual/results/q10-native-dev.md)):
  target-confidence AUROC for a wrong System 1 step is 0.90 [0.85, 0.94] on Calculator and TextEdit, against
  0.80 on the web. After verifier and task fixes, dual is within one task of guarded (13 against 15 of 18,
  [`results/q10b-native-dev.md`](jevdual/results/q10b-native-dev.md)); the gap is one repeated-sequence task.
  Native stays experimental.
- **A session runs beside a person without taking their work, input or focus**
  ([`Q15`](jevdual/docs/experiments/Q15.md)): 15 of 15 coexistence cases passed every check (another app,
  another document of the same process, a foreground step beside an idle or moving person, a conflicting
  edit). `background_only` is the default; `foreground_permitted` holds the front for 36 to 65 ms and only
  after 3 s of idle.

## How it works

```
                 task ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                                                                   ▼
   ┌──────────── System 2: the LLM driver (browser-use loop) ────────────────┐
   │  reads, compares, decides, composes; may call delegate_subgoal /        │

   └──────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┘

   ┌──────────── the guard (code + Jev nouls, ~1 call per check) ────────────┐
   │  destructive gate: pause before delete / pay / send unless the task     │

   │  claims graded against evidence atoms, a per-run ledger by kind         │
   └──────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                  │ optional: dual mode

   │  Nouls: goal_done · stuck · needs_reasoning · destructive · login ·     │
   │  bot_check;  a code-owned arbiter (arbiter.toml) acts, escalates,       │
   │  retries the next-best target, or asks for confirmation                 │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Verification** ([`verify.py`](jevdual/python/jevdual/verify.py), [`ledger.py`](jevdual/python/jevdual/ledger.py)):
  a done is accepted only when the `complete` noul and every requirement's `unmet` noul are inside the
  accept band; answers must quote evidence atoms found on the full page text; requirements that name an
  action are judged from the trajectory once the page has moved on; a requirement judged met stays met
  unless it is a current-state requirement and the page later contradicts it.
- **Gate** ([`agent.py`](jevdual/python/jevdual/agent.py)): keyword and noul rules on the target, the URL,
  the focused element for Enter, and `evaluate`; scoped by the task's `authorized_actions`.
- **Arbiter** ([`arbiter.py`](jevdual/python/jevdual/arbiter.py), [`arbiter.toml`](jevdual/python/jevdual/arbiter.toml)):
  confidence floors, noul thresholds, streak and no-effect rules. Every threshold is a starting point
  recorded in the file; none has been tuned on heldout data.
- **Rust** ([`crates/jevdual-core`](jevdual/crates/jevdual-core)): paint-order occlusion, snapshot lookup,
  element hashes and evidence matching as PyO3 ports with pure-Python twins and equality tests. Honest
  note: the DOM pipeline is not the bottleneck; Jev and the driver are.

## The eval rig

- `evals/`: arms `stock`, `s1_only`, `dual`, `guarded`, `delegate`, `delegate_evidence`; predicates on observed
  state (URL, page text, returned answer, URL checkpoints for multistep tasks), never on the agent's claim;
  browser-use's own LLM judge recorded per row as a comparison, never as the grade.
- Task sets: a local fixture site (`dev`, `heldout`), 55 live dev tasks and 24 live heldout tasks, and 42
  judge-graded tasks imported from browser-use's agent tasks and Mind2Web. Heldout splits are never debugged.
- Method: pre-registered questions with predictions and decision rules, paired bootstrap intervals over
  tasks (`evals/paired.py`), results written after every task run, resumable, secrets redacted.
- browser-use's own CI modules run against this package with the patches active
  (`scripts/upstream_tests.sh`); one of them caught a real bug in the paint-order port.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Tom-R-Main/Footwork.git
cd Footwork/jevdual
uv sync                        # builds the PyO3 crate; Rust 1.95 via rust-toolchain.toml
uv run pytest                  # unit and equality tests, no keys needed
```

To run the agent or the evals you need a TypeSafe key (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`) and a System 2 key
(`MODEL_API_KEY` for the Meta Model API, or wire another provider in `evals/runner.py`):

```sh
uv run python -m evals.runner --split dev --arm stock --arm guarded --arm dual --llm meta
uv run python -m evals.runner --split live-dev --arm guarded --llm meta --task lw-python-creator
uv run python -m evals.paired results/<before> results/<after> --arm dual
```

Use the guard alone with any browser-use agent by constructing `DualProcessAgent` with an `ArbiterHook`
verifier and no S1 policy; see `evals/runner.py` (`guarded` arm) for the exact wiring.

## Status

Research code with a working product core. The guard and the reactive dual loop are measured on the
browser; the native arm and the operator session are measured on a small native split and a coexistence
suite and stay experimental. Delegation and evidence selection are off by default. Open, in order
([`plan`](jevdual/docs/plans/legible-harness.md)): receipts (Q12, running), a narrower contract declaration
(Q11b), native readback and the repeated-sequence rule, one contract across browser and native (Q13), and
whether the browser should go through the accessibility tree too (Q14). Calibration claims wait on the human
audit sheets. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a change.
